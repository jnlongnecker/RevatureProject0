Good testing, make sure that test negative and positive are used correctly. Some tests were marked as Test Negative, but threw no exceptions while Test Positive tests did throw exceptions. The normal case of a method should never be to throw an exception.
Be sure to future-proof triggers (Have all trigger take place on all trigger events and have a case for each)
